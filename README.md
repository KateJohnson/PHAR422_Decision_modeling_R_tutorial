# PHAR422 Decision modeling in R tutorial (Fall 2024)

## Learning Objectives
- Construct a cohort-based Markov model in R
- Determine the ICER and display results on a cost-effectiveness plane
- Develop a probabilistic sensitivity analysis
- Characterize parameter uncertainty using a cost effectiveness acceptability curves


## Installation

We will be working on local installations of R and Rstudio. If you do not already have them downloaded on your computer, 
follow these instructions from the UBC MDS program https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/installation_instructions/.
